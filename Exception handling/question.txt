Practice Questions
Q.1 Write a function that takes a list of strings values (containing both numbers and strings) as input and performs the following tasks:

It initializes a new empty list.
Then, it iterates over this input list.
If the value is an integer, then it calculates the sum of digits and stores the sum in the new list.
If it is a string, then it simply stores NAN(Not a Number) for that place.
In the end, it returns the result.
Sample Input: [‘22’, ‘Sam’, ‘33’, ‘44’]
Sample Output: [4, ‘NAN’, 6, 8]

 

Note: This can also be done using if-else, but for your practice, you should use try-except only.
 

Q.2 Write a function that accepts a list of ages (integers) as input. Now you need to perform the following tasks:

Create a log file named ‘age_log.py’ in append mode.
Iterate through the list of integers.
For each user, you need to check the age and do the following in the log file:
If age <= 0, write a warning message showing ‘Invalid age’.
If age > 18, write a debug message showing ‘adult’.
If age < 18, write a debug message showing ‘teenager’.
Note that the format of the message needs to be {‘date and time’ - ‘name of the logger’ - ‘level’ - ‘message’}.
 

Note: These questions are for your practice. So, try to attempt them before checking the solutions below.
